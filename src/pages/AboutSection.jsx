            Hi, Iâ€™m Arpit Sharma, a dedicated Full-Stack Developer with a strong
            foundation in web technologies and software engineering principles.
            I have hands-on experience working with the MERN Stack (MongoDB,
            Express.js, React, Node.js) to create responsive, user-focused
            applications. Currently, I am focused on advancing my expertise in
            Data Structures & Algorithms to enhance my problem-solving and
            coding efficiency. I am passionate about building scalable
            solutions, learning modern technologies, and continuously improving
            as a developer. My long-term goal is to contribute to impactful
            projects, explore system design, and grow as a well-rounded software
            engineer.
